# GradientGen discord bot

## Why is it named GradientGen?

  GradientGen is the name I decided on because of it's first important feature.

## What is it made in?

  The bot is made in javascript with a few dependencies which help it run and allow for some features.

## How to add it and use it

  ### Adding it

  Bot is simply add with this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=738693849051824160&permissions=1073741815&scope=bot). For the bot to run all it's features properly you need to allow it: read and send messages, manage messages.

  ### So what are all the features I'm talking about?

  Bot can play 3 different games: blackjack, sokoban, snake. Each game has it's own help cards once you run them, everything can be found with &help. Prefix is changable, default is "&". It can send you memes, temporarly mute members and delete messages in bulk.

## Can I use your code?

  You can use my code to run your bot, specific functions... Keep the credits command

## Anything else I should know?

  You are good to go, you can post issues or message me on discord (Goran#0372) for help with the bot or it's code!
