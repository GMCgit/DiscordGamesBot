# My first bot

Hello everyone, this is my github repository for a discord bot I'm making using discord.js. The bot does not have any real direction what it will have or what will it do but it's
a combination of multiple online tutorials and my code. Each function is stored in it's javascript file so you can look at it. Command names are pretty straight foward, if you
want the bot added it should work via link: [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=738693849051824160&permissions=1073741815&scope=bot). Bot will ask you for
a lot of permissions but just unselect the ones you don't want, read and send messages should be enough for it. You can use this code to learn to develop your bot through
making changes to my code. You can probably find better bots for any functions you see here but this one is open source and I think for an example of a simple bot.
## It's current uses

Currently it's most comlex task is creating gradients with formating for a rename command in a Minecraft server (mc-rebels.com if you want to join). It can respond with bar (a joke) and it can bulk delete messages with prune. There are some more jokes like mafs now. I added firebase so you can change the prefix with setPrefix, each prefix must be under 2 characters. validRole doesn't relly work right now. Only server owners (and me) can access commands listed on manageHelp. You can now even get some memes with meme command! Added blackjack fully with embed messages so it looks nicer! Sokoban is a game where you need to push a blue box to a green box. The game is not as easy and there is a chaser who wants to stop you!

### Latest update

In the last to updates (one yesterday and one today) there was a game of snake added, Im pretty sure everyone heard about the game in general


Plans to make this bot are mostly unknown as I do stuff to it when I want or get a fun idea.

# GradientGen discord bot

## Why is it named GradientGen?

  GradientGen is the name I decided on because of it's first important feature.

## What is it made in?

  The bot is made in javascript with a few dependencies which help it run and allow for some features.

## How to add it and use it

  ### Adding it

    Bot is simply add with this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=738693849051824160&permissions=1073741815&scope=bot). For the bot to run all it's features properly you need to allow it: read and send messages, manage messages.

  ### So what are all the features I'm talking about?

    Bot can play 3 different games: blackjack, sokoban, snake. Each game has it's own help cards once you run them, everything can be found with &help. Prefix is changable, default is "&". It can send you memes, temporarly mute members and delete messages in bulk.

## Can I use your code?

  You can use my code to run your bot, specific functions... Keep the credits command

## Anything else I should know?

  You are good to go, you can post issues or message me on discord (Goran#0372) for help with the bot or it's code!
