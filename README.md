# My first bot

Hello everyone, this is my github repository for a discord bot I'm making using discord.js. The bot does not have any real direction what it will have or what will it do but it's
a combination of multiple online tutorials and my code. Each function is stored in it's javascript file so you can look at it. Command names are pretty straight foward, if you
want the bot added it should work via link: [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=738693849051824160&permissions=1073741815&scope=bot). Bot will ask you for
a lot of permissions but just unselect the ones you don't want, read and send messages should be enough for it. You can use this code to learn to develop your bot through
making changes to my code. You can probably find better bots for any functions you see here but this one is open source and I think for an example of a simple bot.
## It's current uses

Currently it's most comlex task is creating gradients with formating for a rename command in a Minecraft server (mc-rebels.com if you want to join). It can respond with bar (a joke) and it can bulk delete messages with prune. There are some more jokes like mafs now. I added firebase so you can change the prefix with setPrefix. validRole doesn't relly work right now. Only server owners (and me) can access commands listed on manageHelp. You can now even get some memes with meme command!


Plans to make this bot are mostly unknown as I do stuff to it when I want or get a fun idea. Current project I'll be working on is blackjack singleplayer and than multiplayer.
